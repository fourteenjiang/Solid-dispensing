CAD Assetsï¼š

This folder contains all the CAD designs for the different 3D-printed parts we used in our process. These include: spoons of various sizes, hoppers, spoon holders, balance adapters. For each asset, two files are provided that include .prt and .stl files.

The .prt files were created using Creo Parametric 9.0.0.0. Furthermore, for ease of access, we also provide .stl files.
