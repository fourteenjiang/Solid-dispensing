It has come to the authorâ€™s attention that some figures in the final version of the doctoral thesis were included without full citation of the original sources. The omissions were unintentional and occurred during the final editing process.

Specifically:

Figure 2.2: Commercial solid dispensing platform, from left to right: Chemspeed GDU-Pfd, Chemspeed GDU-S SWILE, and Chronect XPR robotic systems.

Correction: The figure contains images sourced from the following:
